<p>Rodents, such as rats and mice, pose a common threat in poultry coops, potentially jeopardizing the health and well-being of your flock. These pests not only consume the bird feed but can also transmit diseases and cause damage to infrastructure.</p>

<p>To prevent rodent infestation, adopting proactive measures is crucial. Keep the poultry coop clean and clear of spilled feed, as even a small amount can attract rodents. Regularly inspect the coop for any holes or gaps that may serve as entry points for pests and promptly seal them. You can also implement rodent-proof feeders and strategically placed traps to control their population.</p>

<p>By implementing comprehensive feeding and watering systems for your poultry, you can ensure their well-being and optimize their productivity. Consider creating an efficient feeding system, providing clean and refreshing water, managing feed storage appropriately, and taking preventive measures against rodent infestation. With these practices in place, your poultry will thrive, and you will reap the rewards of a healthy and thriving flock.</p>"
